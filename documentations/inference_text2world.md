## Prerequisites

Before running inference:

1. **Environment setup**: Follow the [Setup guide](setup.md) for installation instructions.
2. **Model checkpoints**: Download required model weights following the [Downloading Checkpoints](setup.md#downloading-checkpoints) section in the Setup guide.
3. **Hardware considerations**: Review the [Performance guide](performance.md) for GPU requirements and model selection recommendations.

## Overview

The Text2World pipeline combines the Text2Image and Video2World models to generate videos directly from text prompts in a two-phase process:

1. **Text2Image generation**: The text prompt is processed by the Text2Image model to create a single still image that serves as the first frame.
2. **Video2World generation**: This image (single-frame conditioning) is then fed into the Video2World model along with the original text prompt to animate it into a dynamic video.

The temporary image created in the first phase is automatically cleaned up after the process completes successfully.

The inference script is located at `examples/text2world.py`.
It requires the input argument `--prompt` (text input).

For a complete list of available arguments and options:
```bash
python -m examples.text2world --help
```

## Examples

### Single Video Generation

This is a basic example for running inference on the 2B model with a text prompt.
The output is saved to `output/text2world_2b.mp4`.

```bash
# Set the input prompt
PROMPT="An autonomous welding robot arm operating inside a modern automotive factory, sparks flying as it welds a car frame with precision under bright overhead lights."
# Run text2world generation
python -m examples.text2world \
    --model_size 2B \
    --prompt "${PROMPT}" \
    --save_path output/text2world_2b.mp4
```

The 14B model can be run similarly by changing the model size parameter.

### Batch Video Generation

For generating multiple videos with different prompts, you can use a JSON file with batch inputs. The JSON file should contain an array of objects, where each object has:
- `prompt`: The text prompt describing the desired video (required)
- `output_video`: The path where the generated video should be saved (required)

An example can be found in `assets/text2world/batch_example.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "prompt": "An autonomous welding robot arm operating inside a modern automotive factory, sparks flying as it welds a car frame with precision under bright overhead lights.",
    "output_video": "output/welding-robot-factory.mp4"
  },
  {
    "prompt": "A wooden sailboat gently moves across a tranquil lake, its sail billowing slightly with the breeze. The water ripples around the hull as the boat glides forward. Mountains are visible in the background under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds.",
    "output_video": "output/sailboat-mountain-lake.mp4"
  },
  {
    "prompt": "A modern kitchen scene where a stand mixer is actively blending cake batter in a glass bowl. The beater rotates steadily, incorporating ingredients as the mixture swirls. A light dusting of flour is visible on the countertop, and sunshine streams in through a nearby window.",
    "output_video": "output/kitchen-mixer-baking.mp4"
  }
]
```

Specify the input via the `--batch_input_json` argument:
```bash
# Run batch text2world generation
python -m examples.text2world \
    --model_size 2B \
    --batch_input_json assets/text2world/batch_example.json
```

This will generate three separate videos according to the prompts specified in the JSON file, with each output saved to its corresponding path.

### Multi-GPU Inference

Text2World supports multi-GPU inference to significantly accelerate video generation, especially for the 14B model. The pipeline uses an optimized two-stage approach:

1. **Text2Image Stage**: Runs only on GPU rank 0 to generate the first frame(s)
2. **Video2World Stage**: Uses context parallelism across all GPUs to generate the final video

To enable multi-GPU inference, use `torchrun` to launch the script:

```bash
# Set the number of GPUs to use
export NUM_GPUS=8

# Run text2world generation with multi-GPU acceleration
torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} -m examples.text2world \
    --model_size 2B \
    --prompt "${PROMPT}" \
    --save_path output/text2world_2b_${NUM_GPUS}gpu.mp4 \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --disable_guardrail \
    --disable_prompt_refiner
```

This distributes the computation across multiple GPUs for the video generation phase (Video2World), with each GPU processing a subset of the video frames. The image generation phase (Text2Image) still runs on a single GPU.


> **Note:** Both parameters are required: `--nproc_per_node` tells PyTorch how many processes to launch, while `--num_gpus` tells the model how to distribute the workload.

**Important considerations for multi-GPU inference:**
- The number of GPUs should ideally be a divisor of the number of frames in the generated video
- All GPUs should have the same model capacity and memory
- Context parallelism works best with the 14B model where memory constraints are significant
- Requires NCCL support and proper GPU interconnect for efficient communication
- Significant speedup for video generation while maintaining the same quality

## API Documentation

The `text2world.py` script supports the following command-line arguments:

Model selection:
- `--model_size`: Size of the model to use (choices: "2B", "14B", default: "2B")

Input parameters:
- `--prompt`: Text prompt describing the video to generate (default: predefined example prompt)
- `--negative_prompt`: Text describing what to avoid in the generated video (default: predefined negative prompt)

Output parameters:
- `--save_path`: Path to save the generated video (default: "output/generated_video.mp4")

Generation parameters:
- `--guidance`: Classifier-free guidance scale for video generation (default: 7.0)
- `--seed`: Random seed for reproducibility (default: 0)
- `--benchmark`: Run in benchmark mode to measure average generation time

Text2Image phase parameters:
- `--use_cuda_graphs`: Use CUDA Graphs for Text2Image inference acceleration
- `--resolution`: Resolution for text2image generation (choices: "480", "720", default: "720")
- `--fps`: FPS for video2world generation (choices: 10, 16, default: 16)

Video2World phase parameters:
- `--dit_path`: Custom path to the DiT model checkpoint for post-trained models

Multi-GPU inference:
- `--num_gpus`: Number of GPUs to use for context parallel inference (default: 1)
- For multi-GPU inference, use `torchrun --nproc_per_node=$NUM_GPUS -m examples.text2world ...`
- Both `--nproc_per_node` (for torchrun) and `--num_gpus` (for the script) must be set to the same value
- Text2Image runs only on rank 0, Video2World uses context parallelism across all GPUs

Batch processing:
- `--batch_input_json`: Path to JSON file containing batch inputs, where each entry should have 'prompt' and 'output_video' fields

Content safety and controls:
- `--disable_guardrail`: Disable guardrail checks on prompts (by default, guardrails are enabled to filter harmful content)
- `--disable_prompt_refiner`: Disable prompt refiner that enhances short prompts (by default, the prompt refiner is enabled)
- `--offload_guardrail`: Offload guardrail to CPU to save GPU memory
- `--offload_prompt_refiner`: Offload prompt refiner to CPU to save GPU memory

## Prompt Engineering Tips

For best results with Text2World models, prompts should describe both what should appear in the scene and how things should move or change over time:

1. **Scene description**: Include details about objects, lighting, materials, and spatial relationships
2. **Motion description**: Describe how elements should move, interact, or change during the video
3. **Temporal progression**: Use words like "gradually," "suddenly," or "transitions to" to guide how the scene evolves
4. **Physical dynamics**: Describe physical effects like "water splashing," "leaves rustling," or "smoke billowing"
5. **Cinematography terms**: Include camera movements like "panning across," "zooming in," or "tracking shot"

Example of a good prompt:
```
A tranquil lakeside at sunset. Golden light reflects off the calm water surface, gradually rippling as a gentle breeze passes through. Tall pine trees along the shore sway slightly, their shadows lengthening across the water. A small wooden dock extends into the lake, where a rowboat gently bobs with the subtle movements of the water.
```

This prompt includes both static scene elements and suggestions for motion that the Video2World model can interpret and animate.
